# Generator Icons Components
There is the need to add icons in our vue components and it is very tedious to be adding all the code of a svg when needed, in that case I have chosen to create a script based on **Heroicons** to generate my icons in components and to import them when I need them.

I understand that this is a simple code, it is still a demo.
